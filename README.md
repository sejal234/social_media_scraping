On the Beto for Texas team, I scraped twitter data to learn about retweets/likes over time, how engagement correlates with key words, and more! 

## What Can I Do?
- [Find & visualize a user's retweets and likes over time](https://github.com/sejal234/social_media_scraping/blob/main/Publishable_Twitter_Metrics_Over_Time.ipynb)
- [How popular are tweets with certain keywords?](https://github.com/sejal234/social_media_scraping/blob/main/Keywords%20Twitter.py)

## What Do I Need?
- Elevated Twitter access. Learn about elevated access [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/elevated). The application only took a day to process for me. 
- I code in Python and use Tweepy, Pandas libraries.
